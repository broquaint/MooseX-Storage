Revision history for MooseX-Storage

0.02 
    * MooseX::Storage::Engine
      - better error reporting when cycles are found
      - class names are now stored as the full identifier
        (<class>-<version>-<authority>) and are checked
        when they are expanded.
        - added docs and tests for this

    This was Chris's idea originally (blame him), and 
    we expanded on it to create what you see here :)
